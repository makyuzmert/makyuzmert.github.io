My research interests focus on international economics, European Union, and socioeconomic determinants of health. 

My research explores the impact of international trade and financial movements on health and income inequality. One strand of research in this area investigates how trade liberalization, foreign direct investment, and globalization shape income inequality in the EU members and OECD countries. Another strand of research in this area understands the interaction between trade&financial openness and health.
My interest in the socioeconomic determinants of health informs policy makers on how international trade&financial transactions help increase healthy behaviour.These research areas uses advanced econometric methods  such as panel cointegration, estimation, and causality tests considering cross-section dependence. 

In my PhD thesis, I analyzed the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty on economic activity in the EU economies, specifically GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) countries. I constructed the uncertainty indices for the US, EU, and GIIPS countries by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) employed for dimensionality reduction in unsupervised machine learning and different conditional heteroskedasticity techniques applied for the measurement of volatility in time series. Then, I estimated the impact of the US, EU, and GIIPS uncertanities on industrial production in the GIIPS countries with the utilization of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) method and Impulse Response (IR) analysis.

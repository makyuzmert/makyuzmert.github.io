In my Ph.D. thesis, I analyzed the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty on economic activity in the EU economies, specifically GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) countries. I constructed the uncertainty indices for the US, EU, and GIIPS countries by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) employed for dimensionality reduction in unsupervised machine learning and different conditional heteroskedasticity techniques applied for the measurement of volatility in time series. Then, I estimated the impact of the US, EU, and GIIPS uncertainties on industrial production in the GIIPS countries with the utilization of the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) method and Impulse Response (IR) analysis.

My research interests focus on international economics, the European Union, and socioeconomic determinants of health. 

My research explores the impact of international trade on health and income inequality. One strand of research investigates how trade liberalization, foreign direct investment, and globalization shape income inequality in EU members and OECD countries. Another strand of research understands the interaction between trade openness and health. My interest in the socioeconomic determinants of health informs policymakers on how international trade help increase healthy behavior. These research areas use advanced econometric methods  such as panel cointegration, estimation, and causality tests considering cross-section dependence.

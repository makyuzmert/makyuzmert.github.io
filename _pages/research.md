My research interests focus on international economics and the European Union.

In my Ph.D. thesis, I analyzed the effect of international macroeconomic uncertainty on economic activity in the EU economies, specifically GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) countries. I constructed the uncertainty indices for the US, EU, and GIIPS countries by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) employed for dimensionality reduction in unsupervised machine learning and different conditional heteroskedasticity techniques applied for the measurement of volatility in time series. Then, I estimated the impact of the US, EU, and GIIPS uncertainties on industrial production in the GIIPS countries with the utilization of the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) method and Impulse Response (IR) analysis.

My research explores the impact of international economic activities on income inequality and population health. One strand of research investigates how trade liberalization, foreign direct investment, and globalization shape income inequality in EU members and OECD countries. Another strand of research understands the interaction between trade openness and population health. My interest in this area informs policymakers on how international trade help increase population health. 

I use advanced econometric methods such as panel cointegration, estimation, and causality tests considering cross-section dependence.

ANAMER aims to set-up a regional-trans regional network of Turkish universities in the field of European studies. In its regional dimension ANAMER gathers five Central Anatolian universities, in order to attain a region-wide impact of the envisaged activities: Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, AYBU Coordinator; Ankara Social Sciences University, ASBU; Çankiri Karatekin University, CKU; Eskişehir Osmangazi University, EOU; Necmettin Erbakan University, NEU; Dokuz Eylul University, DEU, Izmir; Manisa Celal Bayar University, MCBU. The project is co-funded by Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University and European Commission and it is placed within the Erasmus+ project.

ANAMER unites persons sharing interest and passion for integrated Europe. With the ultimate purpose to make Europe and Turkey closer. ANAMER is the first Turkish project aiming to create links and interdisciplinary (economics, international relations, political science, social policy, tourism and law) synergies among universities working on EU issues. ANAMER aims at creating strong synergies among the participating universities in order to re-boost European studies in Turkey and improving their quality at the same time. Dissemination of knowledge on EU will be the driving force of our actions. For that we adopted as motto “Knowledge is more important than everything”, by the renowned Sufi scholar Mevlana.

ANAMER will reinforce the position of AYBU and other partner universities as a centre of specialization in EU studies. ANAMER puts together human resources that otherwise will remain substantially not in touch among them. As actions, will take place in each one of the partner universities, the benefits of the project will flow through the network and display in anyone of the participating universities their effects. The project envisages coherent actions between research, seminars, workshops, panels and deliverables. Anyone of the four research programmes will be discussed in workshops, seminars, panels that will take place in anyone of the participating universities. Existing courses will be enriched by academic mobility that will include both professors of the participating universities and visiting professors. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the topic of “shared values” will be introduced in various courses starting with the second year. These activities will focus on topical issues related with EU political and economic development, with particular reference to Turkey’s accession issues and those related to it.
